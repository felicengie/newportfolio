The challenge was to build a secure, fast, and reproducible pipeline to accelerate model iterations and prepare the system for real-time integration with clinical tools like Epic.",
  how: "Inference Pipeline Optimization: I developed and deployed an ML inference pipeline in Snowflake using SQL and Snowpark container services, enabling the processing of over 2,000 chest X-ray images. By leveraging GPU-accelerated compute pools and container-based execution, we achieved a 25Ã— speedup over traditional Python-based pipelines.\n\nSecure Integration Testing: I worked with MSK's data scientist and product lead to validate and document secure access pathways for 20+ privacy-focused use cases. This included preparing the infrastructure for real-time model calls within Epic.\n\nHackathon Conceptualization: As part of MSK's intern challenge, I co-led the winning team that conceptualized an AI-powered skin cancer detection app designed for at-home use. Our idea focused on accessibility, using image classification to detect skin abnormalities and generate alerts for follow-up care.",
